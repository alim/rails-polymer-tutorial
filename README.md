# Tutorial Description

This tutorial will walk through the process and approach to using
Google Polymer Web Components and Rails 5.1. Polymer is a lightweight
library that helps you take full advantage of Web Components. Web
Components combine HTML elements, CSS and Javascript into self-contained
units.

With Web Components, you can create reusable custom elements that
interoperate seamlessly with the browserâ€™s built-in elements, or
break your app up into right-sized components, making your code
cleaner and less expensive to maintain.

For those new to Ruby on Rails, it provides a framework for building
web-based applications. The framework is based on a Model-View-Controller
architecture. The Web Components defined by the Google Polymer Project
provide a great tool set for constructing the user interface portion of
the Rails framework.

# Organization

This tutorial is composed multiple snapshots of complete application
versions. Each version will be a step toward adding more Polymer Web
Components to it. The versions with corresponding tutorial steps
will be stored in subdirectories of this repository. The tutorial
steps include:

1. [Creation of a sample application and installing Polymer](step-1/README.md)
1. Addition of simple layout for header and navigation
1. Addition of form elements for handling input
